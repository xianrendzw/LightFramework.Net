			Bucket is optional and can be specified in the constructor, so you 
			can use the same configuration to connect to different buckets in the cluster.
			
			You must provide userName and password if the server is "secured" (membase is secured by default).
			
			- bucketPassword (optional) : set the password of your bucket. Optional for membase 1.6+ where the client canfind this out automatically.
			- retryCount (optional, default 0): the number of times to reconnect to a pool url before marking it as dead. (useful for ec2/amazon where the load balancer closes our connection to the pool)
			- retryTimeout (optional, default 2secs): the time to wait between two retry attempts
